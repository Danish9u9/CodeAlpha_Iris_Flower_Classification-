# Iris Flower Classification (KNN)

Classifies Iris flowers (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**) using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** in Python. 
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data loading to model training, evaluation, and saving.

## Features
- Load and explore the Iris dataset with **pandas**
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a **KNN classifier**
- Evaluate model performance with **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**
- Save the trained model using **Joblib**

## Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Place `iris.csv` in the project folder  
2. Run the script:
```bash
python iris_knn.py
```
3. View accuracy, confusion matrix, and access the saved model `iris_model.pkl`

## Ideal For
- Beginners learning **Python and machine learning**
- Practicing **classification tasks**
- Understanding real-world use of **KNN**
